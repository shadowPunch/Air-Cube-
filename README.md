INSTRUCTIONS

Are you ready to play with the Rubik's cube? 
Immerse yourself in a completely new experience, with a Simulated Virtual cube and Motion tracking, and solve the cube in shortest time.

It's not a Rubik's cube. It's an Air Cube!!

OBJECTIVES OF THE GAME

1)Each of the 6 sides is painted a distinct color (red, orange, yellow, white, blue, green), and the goal of the puzzle is to return the cube to a state in which each side has a single color after it has been randomized by repeated rotations.

2)In addition to the methods of Rubik's Cube, Air Cube has some additional rules-

i)The cube has to be solved with a limited number of movements, i.e., Front, Back, Left, Right, Up and Down, as well as their clockwise and Anti-clockwise rotations. 

ii)You can use the cursor to rotate the cube around. However, you must return to the Front side (Red Colour) to make proper rotations. Else, you will end up scrambling up the cube. You don't want that, do you?

iii)The cube is meant to be solved using hand gestures, which are detected by the camera, and cause the cube to rotate. Though that only applies if you can guess the gestures. Don't worry, they are intuitive. However, if it's too difficult, then the motion buttons are there to help.

Hope you have fun cubing.

(NOTE-Aaron can solve a Rubik's cube in 18 seconds. How long do you take?)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HAND GESTURES
#Some of the hand gestures might not work, as they are bug-ridden. We could not resolve some of the bugs due to time contraints.
